# shiny-apps-showcase
A collection of four interactive Shiny applications useful for researches who work on the pain studies to understand the exististing pu and visualization. Explore applications related to hDRG Spatial Transcriptomics, Neuropathic Pain, long read sequencing and Proteomics data. Each app provides an intuitive interface to analyze and interpret data effectively.

List of Applications
## 1. hDRG Spatial Transcriptomics and Neuropathic Pain

**Description:** This RShiny site contains data sets across two complementary papers. In “Mapping Human Nociceptors” we identify transcriptomic signatures of nociceptors. The second data set looks at sex differences in underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain. This application visualizes the gene expression through different plots such as Dot,  Violin, Ridge, Feature, Dim and box plots.

## 2. Interactome

**Description:** This interactome analysis platform identifies potential signaling interactions between cell types of interest using transcriptomic data provided by the user and a curated ligand-receptor database.

🔗 Application Link: [[Interactome Analsis Tool](https://sensoryomics.shinyapps.io/Interactome/)]

## 3. Proteomic

**Description:** This site explores sex-based molecular differences in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), focusing on chronic pain disorders.The findings provide insights into functional differences in sensory and pain mechanisms, with implications for clinical translation.

## 4. hDRG Long Read Sequencing

**Description:** This RShiny site is a companion dashboard for “Isoform expression patterns in the human DRG”. This resource is intended for researchers in the pain and neuroscience field to understand how splicing contributes to neuropathies and chronic pain disorders. You can also explore the Long Read Sequencing Data within the UCSC Genome Browser webpage which is embedded into "Explore" tab.
